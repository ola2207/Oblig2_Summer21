		<h1>Reflection</h1>

        <p>We managed to translate our wirefrimes into code pretty well, but we had some challenges.
        Implementing the page to be responsive to scale and hovers was a challenging aspect but we managed to 
        make the pages work on both mobile and pc.</p>

        <p>In the first version we had some difficulty making the images a specific format in only some cases without 
        strectching them. And making them work in different formats and still be clickable. The menu with the thumbnails 
        looks almost exactly like we planned, it took a lot of work but we learned a lot along the way. We also used time 
        making the text appear only when you hover over it without the command hiding every div element, but after more 
        research we found a method that worked. Unforntunatly this only worked on some of our pages so we ended up 
        dropping the hover-text, both because it was very hard to translate from the wireframes, but also because it
        will not work on mobile.</p>

        <p>In the second version we had some difficulty making the menu work in bigger and smaller formats. The pictures'
        text had to be on the bottom of the pages on mobile, instead of on the side like the wireframes, because 
        otherwise the text would have to be too small to read. The menu also worked better in one line rather than three
        that way it looked less cluncky, and more like it was meant to be on mobile.</p>

        <p>When using the same pictures in different sizes, we used both the "< img>+srcset attribute”, with different file 
        names for the smaller pictures in the second site, and a different img class, with it's own css in the first site. </p>
